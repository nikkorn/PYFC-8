The application can be started with either a directory or a cart image file (*.sfc.png) as a context.

When the context is a directory that becomes the root directory and the user can:
- Create a new cart directory within the root one, containing default cart resources.
- Validate a cart directory to determine whether it can be packed into a cart image file.
- Validate and pack a cart directory into a cart image file.
- Load and unload a cart directory or cart image file so that is is run/restarted on F2.


When the context is a cart image file:
- The cart image file is instantly validated, loaded and runtime started.
- The terminal ONLY serves to:
    - Show cart validation output in the event of a failure.
    - Show runtime output.
    - Show any errors raised by the runtime.


Cart loading
============
Loading a cart from a directory context will cause the cart directory or cart image to be validated and loaded on the device so that it runs on F2.


Runtime
============
A loaded cart will be run when F2 is pressed, and reloaded whenever F2 is pressed again.
If at any point during the runtime an unhandled error occurs the terminal will be shown with any error displayed.
